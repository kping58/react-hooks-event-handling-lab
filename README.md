# React Event System Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice responding to events in React
2. Practice writing event handlers
3. Practice canceling default event handlers

## Overview

This lab should give students a decent handle on `e.preventDefault()` and
`e.stopPropagation()` in the React event system.

It should be dead simple: no need to change state too much, we just want to
attach the handlers and make sure that they're behaving sanely.
